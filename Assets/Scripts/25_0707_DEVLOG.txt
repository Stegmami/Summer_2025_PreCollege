Desiging our C# Code:
Creating a code Pattern:
C# Diagram:

You design your kitchen cabinets according to how you plan to use your kitchen... 
We design our C# Classes according to how we plan to use them.

Move Objects:
	One Triangle moves with Physics
	One Triangle is animated
	One Triangle is translated

	Do all three move when player presses W
	OR
	Can the player choose which object is the active object?

	Logic Required:
		Who is the active object?
	
	Each Triangle has their own code, 
	and they are each coded to work only if their local bool is true

	How to update the 
	Triangles' movement classes need a reference to the Logic script 


	OR

	Each triangle has it's own method
	Method is only called by logic class when Logic's bool is true

	Logic class needs a reference to the triangleGOs

	DECISION:
		Make this simpler!  OMG!


Player:
		Triangle 1: RB2D Physics AddForce(Vector3*Speed*Time.time)

Friend:
		Triangle 2: Ass "speed" to Position.x and Position.y
		
Enemy:
		Triangle does not move, nimates on collision

Classes
		Rigidbody2D
		Animator
		AudioSource

Scripts
		PlayOnCollision2D
		
Methods:		
		OnCollisionEnter2D()
		OnMouseDown()
		Input.GetKey(Keycode.__)

		Timer
		Slider Value
		Score.text
		Score value

		Invoke(Method())
		Delay

		Play several sounds at once
		Stop sounds
		Start others

		Use all the same modular bits of code to create two different games.

		LevelDesign class: 
		At start, turns on the desired GO.  
		Has a PublicGO and designer drags in the GO they want for that level.  
		Null check: If designer forgets to drag in a GO, one is automatically chosen...
		HOW?  Find by name, what if the GO are turned off?  Use transform?  



		TELL STUDENTS:

		// Classes to know well:
			GameObject
			Transform
			Rigidbody2D
			Collision2D
			Collider2D
			Vector3

		// Manual = What Unity can do
		// Scripting is how to do it




		// Abbreviations: only use very common ones Rb2D, GO, 

		// Dream it
		// Start it
		// Dream more specifically
		// Start again
		// Dream much more specifically
		// Make a TODO list: 
			// What do I want my player to be able to do?
			// What do I need to develop do that my player can do it?
			// Break down the tasks for development!
		// Stop dreaming and start crossing tsaks off the list
		// Yes, now you are just working, not designing
		// Start working: Race against the clock to keep it intresting


		My Tasks:
		Make scripts that can be added to GO, 

		1. Movement with Physics
		2. Movement with transform.position
		3. PlayOnCollision2D
		4. UpdateScore Scoreboard keeps and updates the score
		5. PlayOnTriggerEnter2D
		6. ScoreOnTriggerEnter2D  add to a GO that we want to add points

		TODO:	
		Music
		Reset Scene
		UI: Text and updating text at runtime
		Collider2D.OnTriggerEnter2D()
		Singleton?

		To play more than one clip with the same audiosource, use PlayOneShot
            MyAudioSource.PlayOneShot(MySoundFX.CollisionWithEnemy);

			Play() will only play if there is a clip in its public clip spot, and it only plays that clip.
